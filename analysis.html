                        <p>According to research by the eSafety Commissioner, it was found that many within Australia
                            use the Internet to research areas in which they have an interest, with 95% of people using
                            it for that purpose. However, social media did have a significant prevalence, with 5 out of
                            the 10 listed activities utilising a form of social media, with more than 70% of people
                            using technology daily. Out of these 5, the most popular social media usage was chatting
                            with friends with 93%, which also indicates the interconnectedness of social media and the
                            connections made but also the dangers of talking to strangers and how those with malicious
                            intentions can often access these people's accounts and begin chatting. Hence, Social media
                            seems to be largely prevalent within the internet but not the most significant usage of the
                            internet, with research being higher due to the target audience of social media being
                            teenagers who have to complete assignments and research being a significant necessity within
                            assignments.</p>
