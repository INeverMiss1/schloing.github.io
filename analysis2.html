                            <b>How much social media usage could be considered an addiction?</b>
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Addiction is defined as having an uncontrollable urge to use or do a certain activity.
                            Social media can also cause these urges meaning that it can count as an addiction, and in
                            the current day and age where technology and the internet are so prominent in everyday life
                            accessing it and further worsening the addiction is significantly easier to achieve.
                            According to California State University, 210 million people are addicted to social media
                            worldwide, highlighting how social media is making a large impact. In America, 28.1 million
                            people are addicted to alcohol, which is currently the most abundant addiction type
                            worldwide. Social media has been around for only 20 years, whereas alcohol has existed for
                            numerous decades, so imagine what happens when it spreads more and the addiction increases
                            over time.
                            Hence, social media can be considered an addiction and is shaping to be one of the most
                            impactful that there is worldwide if the trend continuess
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As previously mentioned, social media addiction is a growing addiction that will
                            likely be the most common addiction within the next century. S,o let's see what side effects
                            it will have on people and its similarities to other types of addiction.

                            Social media addiction seems to heavily overlap with addictions such as substance abuse and
                            drug usage as it begins to impact a person daily, such as constant headaches and withdrawal
                            symptoms likely to occur when there is no usage of social media for a short period. These
                            will likely affect a person's social life as their mind will start to prioritise the usage
                            of screens and being in the virtual world rather than a practical one. Moreover, there will
                            likely be an effect on sleep as the usage of screens has blue light, which has been proven
                            to affect sleeping habits and proficiency of their deep sleep where their body can usually
                            recharge. Suppose it occurs to an adult with a professional life, such as working in an
                            office. In that case, it will likely urge you to lose track of goals that need to be
                            achieved, and your general thought process will become more rash and aggressive, further
                            impacting your proficiency and your ability to work with colleagues.

                            Hence, social media will likely affect all aspects of the patient's life, causing more
                            agitated and unfocused people to rely on the short doses of dopamine created in their
                            brains.

                            <b>How is the brain growth of kids with social media addiction affected?</b>
                            <i>Note: It is too early to have data, but common trends have been found</i>
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            It is too soon to witness the effects of social media and screen time. Still, some traits
                            have been seen in children who rely on screens, such as early aggression, which their minds
                            gain from social media and the content they are being provided.

                            This pattern of reliance on children is heavily influenced by parents being negligent of
                            what their children are watching and giving screen time for parents to relax and sit back.
                            Yet, when children seem to be interacting more with screens than with conversations with
                            others, they tend to become anti-social and limit the amount of physical activity they
                            participate in.

                            Hence, parents should understand the liking of their children, try to cooperate with them,
                            and encourage them to do their activities, creating time for the parents to sit back and
                            watch while the child develops new skills.
